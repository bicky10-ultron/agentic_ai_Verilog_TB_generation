## 🧠 Bus and Peripheral Verification Using SystemVerilog
## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates the design and verification of multiple digital communication buses and peripheral modules using SystemVerilog.
Each interface is implemented along with its testbench to validate protocol functionality, data transfers, and signal integrity using simulation-based verification.
