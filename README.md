# Agentic AI for Verilog & Testbench Generation

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Agentic AI for Verilog & Testbench Generation** is an automation tool that leverages an AI agent to generate SystemVerilog modules and corresponding testbenches. The agent is designed to accelerate verification workflows by producing synthesizable Verilog (or SystemVerilog) code, generating testbenches with stimulus, and helping automate simulation runs. This project is ideal for hardware designers and verification engineers who want to prototype RTL quickly or bootstrap verification environments.
